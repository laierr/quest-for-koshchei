# HORCRUX OF KOSHCHEI

## What is it?
This is a small exercise I devised to help explain the concept of embedded objects and ways to access them. It is based on Slavic folklore, specifically the story of Koshchei the Immortal.

## Objective
The objective of this exercise is to locate and call the `snap()` function, which is embedded deep inside the `horcrux_of_koshchei` object.

## The Legend
According to the legend of Koshchei the Immortal, he hid his death at the end of a needle, and it had to be snapped in order to defeat him.

### Where is the Needle?
According to the legend:
* The *Needle* is hidden inside the *Egg*.
* The *Egg* is hidden inside the *Duck*.
* The *Duck* is hidden inside the *Rabbit*.
* The *Rabbit* is hidden inside the *Chest*.
* The *Chest* is chained to the *Ancient Oak Tree*.
* The *Ancient Oak Tree* is located on *Buyan Island*.

This forms an object-within-object allegory.

The bulk of the `horcrux_of_koshchei` object was generated with ChatGPT.
